<h2>"Untitled", Dec. 2019, Video <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> My final project used aftereffects and premiere in order to create a video showcasing the various flowers in my front yard as well as in my grandmother’s backyard. The difficult part of this is that since it’s winter there wasn’t really many flowers at my grandmother’s house. I drew the white elements in the first two sections of the video in photoshop and then messed around with them in aftereffects in order to create the motion that you see in the video. A challenge I faced was that I had a lot of difficulty thinking up what to put onto each image or video. For some I thought just a simple gif worked but for others I pictured much harder to make effects. Such as for the first section. I had to create each key frame so that way they moved in a way that made sense and looked more like water. I also manually moved each item simply because I didn’t really know a simpler way to go about it.
  Something I learned while doing this project is that aftereffects is not totally user friendly to draw things directly onto the picture. I couldn’t find a way to animate the markups directly on aftereffects which is why I imported the drawings from photoshop.
  Moving forward with digital media I really liked 2 specific projects of ours: the aftereffects project and the glitch art project. I do think I’ll find ways to integrate glitch art into my work later. I really like the spontaneity of glitch art. For aftereffects what I really liked was just being able to create videos, this was something I don’t do very often so I liked having the tools to now do it. I’ve already been thinking about projects moving forward that I would like to create visuals for that I think aftereffects would be perfect for.
