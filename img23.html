<h2>"Untitled", Dec. 2019, Video <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> My final project used after effects and premiere in order to create a video showcasing the various flowers in my front yard as well as in my grandmother’s backyard. The difficult part of this is that since it’s winter there wasn’t really many flowers at my grandmother’s house. I drew the white elements in the first two sections of the video in photoshop and then messed around with them in after effects in order to create the motion that you see in the video. A challenge I faced was that I had a lot of difficulty thinking up what to put onto each image or video. For some I thought just a simple gif worked but for others I pictured much harder to make effects. Such as for the first section. I had to create each key frame so that way they moved in a way that made sense and looked more like water. I also manually moved each item simply because I didn’t really know a simpler way to go about it. Although this took a long time I did like the effect it created on the overall video and do think it turned out good.
	Something I learned while doing this project is that after effects is not totally user friendly to draw things directly onto the picture. I couldn’t find a way to animate the markups directly on after effects which is why I imported the drawings from photoshop.
	I used a lot of gifs here. I think that overall I was just testing out the different after effects tools to see what I liked. This was a lot of experimentation and I really enjoyed doing it.
	Moving forward with digital media I really liked 2 specific projects of ours: the after effects project and the glitch art project. I do think I’ll find ways to integrate glitch art into my work later. I really like the spontaneity of glitch art. For after effects what I really liked was just being able to create videos, this was something I don’t do very often so I liked having the tools to now do it. I’ve already been thinking about projects moving forward that I would like to create visuals for that I think after effects would be perfect for.
	I also think that through this class I was able to get a better understanding of photoshop and illustrator than I had before. I learned about a lot of new programs I had not heard of such as meshmixer and audacity. All of these programs helped to deepen my knowledge of the digital media arts. I hope that now I’ll be able to integrate these tools into my own work to help me become a better artist.
