<h4>"UFO", Sept. 2019, Audacity and Illustrator <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> <br> For this project I created an image using illustrator. I used the ellipses, minus front, and unite tool in order to create a UFO illustration. Afterwards I edited it using the channels layers on Photoshop. After I was satisfied with messing with the layers panel I opened the file up in Audacity. I then used the effects panel until I finally found an image I liked. I was inspired by Cooper Landscape I by Claudia Mate, I loved the sci-fi nature of her work and took it much more literal and decided to make a spaceship. My concept for this work was mostly "abduction" I thought distorting an image with a UFO might give it even more of a sci-fi look. </span></h4>
