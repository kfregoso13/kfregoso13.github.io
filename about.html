  <p class= "statement"> Kaitlyn Fregoso is a multimedia artist who largely creates work based on the highs and lows she<span>&#39;</span>s faced in friendships and connections with others. It elaborates upon snapshots in time. Not only does her work focus on the connections she<span>&#39;</span>s made with others, but it also takes a look at our current political climate. Her work takes action to make change in some of the injustices that seem to be a daily occurrence now.
She works largely with photography but also uses other mediums such as resin, clay or laser cutting. She also is expermenting with digital media tools now such as photoshop and 3D models. Her work is unique in that she doesn<span>&#39;</span>t have one specific medium she is tied within the bounds of. Instead she is constantly finding new and innovative ways to present her ideas through new tools.
